        physical and managerial. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and

        in a secure physical environment. The servers have industry standard firewalls. Access to such servers is
        password protected and access by our employees is limited. Currently, we use Secure Socket Layer software
        ("SSL") to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information including credit card
        number(s), and names and addresses, as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that,
