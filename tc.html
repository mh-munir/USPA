      <a class="anchor" id="purchases"></a>
      <h3>4. Terms Applicable to Purchases</h3>

      <p><strong><u>A. Generally.</u></strong> To purchase any products or services in the Company online store, you
        must be at least eighteen (18) years of age or the applicable age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence.
        Prior to the purchase of any products or services, you must provide us with a valid credit card number and
        associated payment information including all of the following: (i) your name as it appears on the card, (ii)
        your credit card number, (iii) the credit card type, (iv) the date of expiration, and (v) any activation numbers
        or codes needed to charge your card. By submitting that information to us or our third party credit card
        processor, you agree that you authorize us and/or our processor to charge your card at our convenience but
        within thirty (30) days of credit card authorization. For any product or service that you order on the Site, you
        agree to pay the price applicable (including any sales taxes and surcharges) as of the time you submit the
        order. Company will automatically bill your credit card or other form of payment submitted as part of the order
        process for such price. Please note that we do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price
        drop or promotional offering.</p>

      <p><strong><u>B. Methods of Payment, Credit Card Terms and Taxes.</u></strong> All payments must be made through
        your Visa, MasterCard or Discover (if available). We currently do not accept cash, personal or business checks
        or any other payment form, although in the future we may change this policy. Your card issuer agreement governs
        your use of your designated card, and you must refer to that agreement and not these Terms to determine your
        rights and liabilities as a cardholder. You represent and warrant that you will not use any credit card or other
        form of payment unless you have all necessary legal authorization to do so. YOU, AND NOT COMPANY, ARE
        RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY UNAUTHORIZED AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY. You agree to pay
        all fees and charges incurred in connection with your purchases (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in
        effect when the charges were incurred. Unless you notify Company of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days
        after they first appear on your credit card statement, you agree that they will be deemed accepted by you for
        all purposes. If Company does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay
        all amounts due upon demand by Company or its agents. Sales taxes, or other taxes, customs, import/export
        charges, or similar governmental charges are not included in the price of the products. You are responsible for
        paying any such taxes or charges imposed on your purchases, including, but not limited to, sales, use or
        value-added taxes. Company shall automatically charge and withhold the applicable tax for orders to be delivered
        to addresses within and any states or localities that it deems is required in accordance with our order policy
        in effect at the time of purchase.</p>

      <p><strong><u>C. Return Policy.</u></strong> All purchase transactions made through the Site are subject to
        Company's return policy and/or money back guarantee policy in effect at the time of purchase.</p>
      <p><strong><u>D. Order Acceptance Policy.</u></strong> Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order
        confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to
        sell. Company reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any
        reason. Company further reserves the right any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to
        supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. Your order will be deemed accepted by Company upon our
        delivery of products or services that you have ordered. We may require additional verifications or information
        before accepting any order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that, if we cancel all or a portion of your
        order or if we provide you less than the quantity you ordered, your sole and exclusive remedy is either that:
        (a) we will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount charged for the cancelled portion or the
        quantity not provided (if your credit card has already been charged for the order) or (b) we will not charge
        your credit card for the cancelled portion of the order or the quantity not provided. Do not assume that a
        cancellation or change of an order you have placed with Company has been effected until you receive a
        confirmation from Company via email or the Site. As stated above, you will be responsible for, and your credit
        card or third-party payment account may be charged for, the payment of all fees associated with orders already
        processed or shipped before your cancellation/change request or a request to terminate your account was
        received.</p>

      <p><strong><u>E. No Responsibility to Sell Mispriced Products or Services.</u></strong> We do our best to describe
        every item, product or service offered on this Site as accurately as possible. However, we are human, and
        therefore we do not warrant that specifications or pricing on the Site is complete, accurate, reliable, current,
        or error-free. In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications of any item, product or
        service, Company shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders in its sole discretion. If we charged your
        credit card or other account prior to cancellation, we will issue a credit to your account in the amount of the
        charge. Additional terms may apply. If a product you purchased from Company is not as described, your sole
        remedy is to return it in unused condition, complete and undamaged, in the original packaging.</p>

      <p><strong><u>F. Modifications to Prices or Billing Terms.</u></strong> The purchase of products and services on
        the Site is subject to availability. PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DISPLAYED ON THE SITE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT ALL
        TIMES AND MAY BE SUBSTITUTED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT, AT ANY TIME, TO CHANGE ITS
        PRICES AND BILLING METHODS FOR SERVICES SOLD, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY UPON POSTING ON THE SITE OR BY E-MAIL
        DELIVERY TO YOU.</p>

        emails from address-change.org and may unsubscribe from such emails by clicking a link contained in the email

      <h3>10. Dispute Resolution</h3>

      <p>Certain portions of this Section 10 are deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal
        Arbitration Act. You and Company agree that we intend that this Section 10 satisfies the "writing" requirement
        of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section 10 can only be amended by mutual agreement.</p>

      <p><strong><u>A. First ? Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes.</u></strong> If any controversy,
        allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Site, the Content, your User Content, these Terms, or any
        Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, <strong>"Dispute"</strong>), or to any
        of Company's actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an <strong>"Excluded Dispute"</strong>, which
        includes those actions set forth in Section 10(D), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other
        providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.
        Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if
        no such contact information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this
        Section 10(A). Your notice to us must be sent to: <a
          href="mailto:admin@address-change.org">admin@address-change.org</a>. For a period of sixty (60) days from the
        date of receipt of notice from the other party, Company and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to
        resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Company to resolve the
        Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and Company, in each of our sole discretion, are
        not comfortable.</p>

      <p><strong><u>B. Binding Arbitration.</u></strong> If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 10(A)
        (or agree to arbitration in writing with respect to an Excluded Dispute) within sixty (60) days of receipt of
        the notice, then ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING
        ARBITRATION. THIS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BASED ON ANY PRODUCT, SERVICE OR ADVERTISING CONNECTED TO THE
        PROVISION OR USE OF THE SITE (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT ? INCLUDING, BUT
        NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD, ANY OTHER INTENTIONAL TORT OR COMMON LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION,
        RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR, AGENCY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY ? AND WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE
        EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS. The Federal Arbitration Act (<strong>"FAA"</strong>) shall govern the
        arbitrability of all disputes between COMPANY and you regarding these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and the
        Site, including the No Class Action Matters section below. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS
        RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY.A Dispute will be resolved solely by binding
        arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (<strong>"JAMS"</strong>), in
        accordance with the then-current streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (<strong>"Rules"</strong>) of, or
        by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of Company
        consent to in writing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the
        "metropolitan statistical area" (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the
        Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other
        costs in accordance with the applicable Rules; but if applicable Rules or laws require Company to pay a greater
        portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 10 to be enforceable, then Company will have the
        right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. The arbitrator will apply and be bound by
        these Terms and any Additional Terms, and will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based
        upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award only in favor of the individual party
        seeking relief and only to the extent to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. Issues
        relating to the enforceability of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions contained herein are for
        the court to decide.</p>

      <p><strong><u>C. Limited Time to File Claims.</u></strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF
        YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT A EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE
        IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 10(A)) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES ?
        OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED. Commencing means, as applicable: (a) by delivery of written notice as set forth
        above in Section 10(A); (b) filing for arbitration with JAMS as set forth in Section 10(B); or (c) filing an
        action in state or Federal court. The parties expressly waive any contrary statute of limitations or time bars,
        both legal and equitable, to the Disputes.

      </p>
      <p><strong><u>D. Injunctive Relief.</u></strong> The foregoing provisions of this Section 10 will not apply to any
        legal action taken by Company to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss,
        cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, your User Content
        and/or Company's intellectual property rights (including such Company may claim that may be in dispute),
        Company's operations, and/or Company's products or services.

      </p>
      <p><strong><u>E. No Class Action Matters.</u></strong> YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
        THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
        OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR AS AN ASSOCIATION. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and
        will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or
        controversy of any other party. There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class
        action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the
        general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated. But if, for any reason, any court with
        competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in
        Section 10(B) to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to
        Section 10(F). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10, any and all issues relating to the scope,
        interpretation and enforceability of the class action waiver provisions contained herein (described in this "No
        Class Action Matters" section), are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the
        arbitrator. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class action waiver provisions.

      </p>
      <p><strong><u>F. Federal and State Courts in Miami Dade County, Florida.</u></strong> Except where arbitration is
        required above, small claims actions, or with respect to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award,
        any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute arising hereunder may only be instituted in
        state or Federal court in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Accordingly, you and Company consent to the exclusive
        personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.

      </p>
      <p><strong><u>G. Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement.</u></strong> Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court
        of competent jurisdiction.

      <h3>14. Updates to Terms</h3>
      <p>These Terms (or if applicable Additional Terms), in the form posted at the time of your use of the applicable
        services to which it applies, shall govern such use (including transactions entered during such use). AS OUR
        SITE EVOLVES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OFFER THE SITE MAY PROSPECTIVELY BE MODIFIED AND WE MAY
        CEASE OFFERING THE SITE UNDER THE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR WHICH THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED. ACCORDINGLY,
        EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN
        APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SITE
        (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE AFTER SUCH NOTICE
        CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS. Therefore, you
        should review the posted terms of service and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Site (at
        least prior to each transaction or submission). The new terms will be effective as to new use and transactions
        as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you.
        However, the terms of service (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the
        Site will continue to apply to such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually
        agreed. In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be
        insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs.
        You should frequently check the home page, and the email you associated with your purchases for notices, all of
        which you agree are reasonable manners of providing you notice. You can reject any new, revised or Additional
        Terms by discontinuing use of the Site and related services.</p>
